<br>
<h2>The application handles automatically the images you include in your articles <i>individually</i> or group them in <i>galleries</i>.</h2>
<h4>Select Individually if you prefer your visitors to open each image in a modal view* whenever they click on them without leaving your page.</h4>
<h4>Select Gallery if you prefer all the images you include inside your article to be grouped and displayed in a gallery style modal view* with next and previous buttons, going through each and every one picture without leaving the page.</h4>
<p>Don't forget to enable the plugin once you install it. It doesn't start automatically!</p>
<h6>* What is modal view? <br>
Well, it's that thing when you click on a picture and the whole page becomes dark, your picture appears right in the center drawing the viewers attention uninterruptedly.</h6>
